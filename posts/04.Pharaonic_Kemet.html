  reverse the situation. The Hittites had many dead in their ranks and fled into the swamps. The victorious

  Ramesu Maryimana ruled for 66 years, the second longest in Egyptian history. Its duration represents 
  half of the 19th dynasty. He had more than a hundred children. He experienced many bereavements 
  with the death of his presumptive successors and his beloved wife Nefertari. The legendary pharaoh 
  died at the age of 90, leaving a state that had regained all its political, economic, religious and 
  cultural power. His death was perceived as an apocalypse by his citizens who were almost all born 
  during his reign.Ramesu Maryimana ruled for 66 years, the second longest in Egyptian history. Its
