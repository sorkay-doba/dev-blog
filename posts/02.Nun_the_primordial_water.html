    There is only one religion in authentic Africa. What are its foundations? Why is it called animism? 
    At the end of this article, you will never look at Africa in the same way.There is only one religion 
    in authentic Africa. What are its foundations? Why is it called animism? At the end of this article, 
    you will never look at Africa in the same way.
    
    Let’s go back to 200,000 years ago. The anatomically modern human just comes to life in Africa. He is 
    already as intelligent as present humans. He is birthed on a land where climate is mild and food is 
    abundant. He is a human with rudimentary needs. The nature, in which he is placed, materially fulfils 
    him.Let’s go back to 200,000 years ago. The anatomically modern human just comes to life in Africa. 
    He is already as intelligent as present humans. He is birthed on a land where climate is mild and food 
    is abundant. He is a human with rudimentary needs. The nature, in which he is placed, materially 
    fulfils him.
    
    Worriless, he-she ends up asking himself fundamental questions in the original cradle of the Great Lakes 
    and Southern Africa: Who am I? Did someone create me? If yes, how? Why was I created? That’s the 
    beginning of philosophy.Worriless, he-she ends up asking himself fundamental questions in the original 
    cradle of the Great Lakes and Southern Africa: Who am I? Did someone create me? If yes, how? Why was I 
    created? That’s the beginning of philosophy.
    
    To answer his philosophical questions, the African observes at length all his surroundings. He finds 
    that there is an Energy; that all things are animated by this Energy; that every life is life because 
    of this Energy; that this energy makes the sun shine, makes the wind blow, warms Earth, makes humans 
    and animals walk, makes plants and minerals vibrate. This energy flows from one body to another, it 
    never dies.To answer his philosophical questions, the African observes at length all his surroundings.

    humans and animals walk, makes plants and minerals vibrate. This energy flows from one body to another, 
    it never dies.
    
    Then, the African understands that this energy is the commander of all things, it is the origin of life 
    with which it merges. This energy that lives in all things, is the ancestor of all things, the primordial 
    Ancestor. Since, from his-her point of view, this energy has given birth to beings as she-he thinks, then 
    this energy has feminine and masculine aspects, because only a couple can conceive. But how did this Energy, 
    to whom he owes his life, came to life?Then, the African understands that this energy is the commander of

    Nun, the primordial waterNun, the primordial water
    
    The Kamit (Black) still observes and understands that water gives birth to life. Water is the starting point 
    of life, it contains life in a microscopic state. Water ponds enable hatching of life, the man’s semen is a 
    liquid containing the germs of life. The conceived child, like the mammalian animal, grows up and leaves the 
    amniotic fluid of the mother contained in a cavity. The bird is born out of the liquid contained in the egg, 
    etc.The Kamit (Black) still observes and understands that water gives birth to life. Water is the starting

    Then the African concluded that at the beginning of everything there was liquid: Nun in ancient Egyptian, 
    Uthlanga among the Zulu, Tano among the Akans of Ghana / Ivory Coast, Nommo among the Dogons of Mali.Then the

    The Dogon of Mali, a people known for their advanced knowledge in astronomy, still consider Nommo, the 
    primordial water, as the sacred source.The Dogon of Mali, a people known for their advanced knowledge in

    The Nun has always been there, no one created it, and the Nun possessed within itself all the potentialities 
    of life, all the germs of life, in a disordered and sleepy state. These potentialities are what physics calls

    The Nun was a sea, a soup of particles moving in a disorderly way, and whose movement ended in a bottomless 
    hole, the black hole of today’s Western physicists, which the Basas of Cameroon call Sonkum. Energy comes 
    from one of these particles contained in the Nun. This particle from which Energy came was called Atum by 
    the ancient Egyptians, Nkolo by the baKongo.The Nun was a sea, a soup of particles moving in a disorderly

    Atum, present in the NunAtum, present in the Nun
    
    Atum, the particle from which Creation sprang, ended up being aware of himself-herself. Atum was first hidden 
    in the Nun (Imana / Amen in ancient Egyptian). Awareness of Atum, his awakening, represents the founding act 
    of Creation. As a particle from which creation emerges, she-he is symbolized by an egg that the Central African 
    Fangs call Aki Ngoss, which the Egyptians called Suhet, which the Fulanis call Botcchio’ndé, and which inspired 
    the name of famous king Behanzin of current Benin, a Voodoo worshiper.Atum, the particle from which Creation

    After studying the state of Nun, being matured through acquisition of Sia (knowledge), Atum conceived the 
    plan of creation in his heart. And when the plan was completed, he-she decided to leave the Nun. It is the 
    extraction of the creative particle of Nun that would engender the world.After studying the state of Nun,

    of Nun that would engender the world.
    
    Atum having engendered creation by will, reflection and decision, he therefore has a soul (Ba) in his heart 
    (Ib). In order to determine the mode and movements related to the exit of the Nun, the Kamit still observes, 
    studies the sky (astronomy), and realizes that the geometric form of the spiral is omnipresent around him.

    Energy at its maximum expression, is in a spiral form like a hurricane or like waves. Galaxy is organized 
    in a spiral form, the magnetic field of the sun has a spiral shape, the movement of the Earth around the 
    sun draws a spiral, the fetus in the mother’s womb has a spiral position, fingerprint is in spiral, and 
    even DNA (did they already know?) is a spiral. DNA is found in minerals, plants, animals and humans.

    So for the African, the spiral is the Energy’s maximum form of expression and the form that stabilizes 
    the whole creation. The spiral is the imprint of the Creator on creation. The initial movement of Creation

    Atum thus came out of the Nun forming a spiral. Atum, the conscious particle, after conceiving the plan of 
    creation in his heart, made energy emerge from himself to escape the Nun. And as a particle acting by its 
    Energy, he-she is called Râ / Ré in ancient Egyptian, Sé in Bambara in Mali, Tei in Douala in Cameroon, 
    Ngo by the baKongo.Atum thus came out of the Nun forming a spiral. Atum, the conscious particle, after

    a loud noise, hence the Hu (the creative Word) or Me Kobegue among the Fangs of Central Africa.Ra, the force

    Debnen in ancient Egyptian, Yereyeti among the Bambara, the whirlwind of the Venda of South Africa, 
    the spiral is the geometric form of Creation. Cameroonian scholar Eugène Wonyu says Debnen in ancient 
    Egyptian, Yereyeti among the Bambara, the whirlwind of the Venda of South Africa, the spiral is the 
    geometric form of Creation. Cameroonian scholar Eugène Wonyu says “All African myths about human’s origin 
    start from either an egg, a spiral or a nothingness that experiences vibrations due to cosmic energies”

    By studying the spirals present around him, the Kamit through mathematical computations realizes that 
    there is a perfect number of the proportions of matter, this number is 1.6. This is what Westerners 
    call nowadays the golden number, the number that represents the law of the Universe. And it is from 
    this golden number that the Kamits drew their spiral.By studying the spirals present around him, the

    It is Ra, produced by Atum, who assembled the particles of the Nun to produce matter and antimatter. 
    Matter is fertile and continuous, from which comes Creation. The antimatter is sterile and nullifies 
    the Creation by opposing the matter. The line where the odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) are, is the 
    matter. The line on which the even numbers (2, 4, 6, and 8) are found is the antimatter.It is Ra,

    The matter only, which is not neutralized by antimatter, generated all the elements of Creation. It is from 
    the surplus of matter that Creation was released. The fertile matter is thus Osiris the good, Usiré in 
    ancient Egyptian, Osoro among the Akan people, Awzaar among the Somali, Ngai Narok among the Maasai, Neddo 
    among the Fulani, Ryangombe in Rwanda. And the forbidden antimatter Suté (Seth) is the sterile evil, Ngai 
    Nanyoke among the Maasai. It is Suté who will lead to Satan in the white religions. So, there was a battle 
    between Usiré and Suté, both sons of Ra, in the beginning. And it is thanks to Ma’at that the matter has 
    triumphed and that Creation has taken place.The matter only, which is not neutralized by antimatter,

    In summaryIn summary
    
    In the beginning, there was the Nun, the primordial water, where Imana, the hidden particle, awakened 
    under his name Atum. Atum, symbolized by an egg, conceived Creation in his-her heart (Ib). She-He decided 
    through his-her soul (Ba) to come out of the Nun to create through his-her Energy Ra. Ra, under the golden 
    number 1.6, drew a spiral movement and propagated in the Nun by emitting a sound vibration (creating 
    word).In the beginning, there was the Nun, the primordial water, where Imana, the hidden particle,

    She-He decided through his-her soul (Ba) to come out of the Nun to create through his-her Energy Ra. 
    Ra, under the golden number 1.6, drew a spiral movement and propagated in the Nun by emitting a sound 
    vibration (creating word).
    
    Thanks to his-her spiral movement, Ra produced matter and antimatter in opposition. Matter (Usiré/Horo) 
    defeated antimatter (Suté) thanks to Ma’at. Horo represents the eternity of Creation and Kheper is the 
    transformation of the created matter. Both depend on Ma’at and are symbolized by number 9. Each element 
    of creation bears a part (Ka) of Energy (Ra).Thanks to his-her spiral movement, Ra produced matter and

    Ra, scientific creative energy venerated by the Kamits (Blacks), is therefore God. God is that Energy 
    which the African reach out to Ra, scientific creative energy venerated by the Kamits (Blacks), is 
    therefore God. God is that Energy which the African reach out to through a dead ancestorthrough a dead

    God has never revealed himself-herself to Africans, She-He remains Imana (Hidden, Invisible). It is this

    Ra is therefore unique (initial and totalizing energy) and multiple (energy distributed in each element of

    We see that the concept of God for Blacks is scientific and perfectly rational. It is based on the 
    exact sciences and philosophical speculation. ThisWe see that the concept of God for Blacks is

    If we reject this religion today, it is because we do not know it, because the European and Arab 
    colonists slandered and soiled it for the purposes of exploiting Africa. We can only feel 
    incredibly honored to have been made African and to have the blood of our great ancestors flowing 
    through our veins.If we reject this religion today, it is because we do not know it, because the

    But outside the spiritual framework, we see other benefits for Africa. African Religion lays the 
    foundation of a completely revised education, a redesigned social system, a redesigned economic 
    system, an upgraded women’s status, a re-foundation of our States, a redesigned architecture, the 
    foundation of conservatories of music, philosophy schools, etc.But outside the spiritual framework,

    In schools, we can imagine workshops on the physical study of Atum, the mathematical study of the 
    spiral or the great pyramid or reflections on Ma’at. What exciting topics! By putting the African 
    child in the continuity of the genius of his/her ancestors, the school failure rate could 
    considerably drop and we could have as many geniuses as we had 2500 years ago. This science is 
    the path towards the scientific renaissance of the black world, towards the rebirth of Kama 
    (Africa).In schools, we can imagine workshops on the physical study of Atum, the mathematical study

    We sincerely thank our ancestors for leaving us such heritage and we must try to make them proud.
