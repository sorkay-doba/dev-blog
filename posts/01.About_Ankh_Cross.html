          <p>What is really the meaning of the ANKH key?<p/>
            
            <p>The Ankh Cross (bow of life, Crux Ansata, cross with hinge, Egyptian cross) is such 
            an important occult and sacred symbol for ancient Egypt that it is difficult to find 
            any religious depiction of Egyptian gods where this mysterious sign would not be present. 
            It was usually portrayed on the tombs and temple walls. But why? What was it about the 
            ANKH cross that made it so important to the ancient mystics?</p>

            <p>What does the Ankh cross look like:</p>                   

            <p>The Cross of  the Ankh is said to be a duplicate of an equally known occult symbol, 
            the cross of Tau, but in contrast, a loop or circle is added to the top of the horizontal bar. 
            It is one of the oldest sacred signs with a deep symbolic value. The house in the temple of 
            the highest priests was called the Ankh and the priests themselves were also called Ankhs.</p>

            <p>The ANKH KEY was the symbol of ancient civilizations:</p>

            <p>The Cross of the Ankh appeared in ancient Egypt, almost becoming it’s “esoteric logo”, but some 
            researchers and theosophists claim that it actually came from even more ancient times, from the 
            lost civilizations of Atlantis, Lemuria, and so on. So, the cross of the Ankh can be seen as a 
            symbol to hundreds of thousands of generations of mysticism and as a secret code that transmits 
            sacred knowledge to all who can penetrate its deep symbolism, those who have the key to 
            understanding the sacred metaphors.</p>

            <p>Symbolic meaning of the ANKH:</p>  
            
            <p>Literally, the term "ankh" in translation from Egyptian means "life" or "who lives."      
            In an unusual cross of the Ankh, two characteristics are combined: a cross which is a symbol of 
            life, and a circle which is a symbol of eternity. As a result, we get a deep symbol representing 
            the immortal, the man who was able to resurrect himself in eternity. This is the cross of the ankh.      
            The combination of a circle and a cross is also a sign of a spiritual and material combination, 
            a symbol of initiation, a second birth, and a symbol of the vision of the etheric worlds.      
            Some researchers of esoteric symbolism have interpreted the backbone of the Ankh (Cross of Tau) 
            as a symbol of the descent of the spirit into matter, and the circle as the "divine Eye” that shines 
            the light on the world of men.</p>   
            
            <p>In addition, the cross of the Ankh symbolizes the union of the female and male gods, Osiris and Isis, 
            and thus the alliance of the Earth and the sky.</p>

            <p>Cross of Ankh in Egyptian mythology:</p>      

            <p>The cross of the Ankh is associated with the solar gods of Atum and RA. A sun disc with sun rays, 
            on the ends of which the hands holding the Ankh, was interpreted as a symbol that the life of plants, 
            animals and humans is given by the sun.</p>

            <p>The Ankh was also connected with Osiris, the god of the reproductive forces of nature and the king of 
            the afterlife.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the goddess of truth “Ma’at” was also portrayed with the cross of the ankh in her hand.</p>                 

            <p>The Cross of the Ankh in Egyptian magic:</p>
            
            <p>The ancient Egyptians portrayed the mysterious cross of the Ankh on their amulets to prolong life on 
            earth. Egyptians buried their dead with such an amulet to make sure that the dead were waiting for a 
            life in another world. Because they were convinced that the key that opened the gates to heaven looked 
            exactly like the cross of the Ankh. For this reason, the cross of the Ankh was an essential item of 
            the gods and pharaohs.</p>
            
            <p>God, the guardian of the body, would place the Ankh key into the Pharaoh's mouth, which meant that 
            the key must be inside the person because it is connected to breathing. The cross of the Ankh even 
            in its form resembles a key, and on the level of symbolism it is. It means "an instrument", which 
            allows you to penetrate beyond the normal human perception, so the Mystics considered it the key to 
            the gates of paradise.</p>
            
            <p>Also, ancient mystics believed that the cross of the Ankh elevated the human to the superhuman, to 
            the divine. Those who were initiated into the world of the mystics, had to pass through various tests 
            while holding the ankh on top of their head in order to dispel negative energies.</p>      

            <p>Cross of Ankh in other cultures:</p>
            
            <p>The Ankh cross was used by Coptics, who also associated it with the afterlife, and it was a symbol of 
            eternal life in Christ. Some researchers even suggest that it was the cross of the Ankh that was the 
            prototype of the golden key from Heaven or Paradise that St. Peter held.  </p>
            
            <p>In Babylon, the Ankh was a symbol of heaven and immortality.</p>
            
            <p>The Cross of Ankh was also known as the mystical symbol of the Indians of Central America. They 
            associated it with water.</p>
            
            <p>To the Scandinavians the cross of the Ankh was a symbol of rejuvenation.</p>
            
            <p>The Ankh and Occult tradition:</p>
            
            <p>In the esoteric traditions, Cross of the Ankh acted as a key to divine, secret knowledge, hidden 
            wisdom, power and supremacy. It is formed from a combination of male and female symbols Osiris (OSIRIS)
            and ISIS (ISIS) as the Union of Heaven and Earth, life and death.</p>

            <p>The Ankh Cross is a symbol of life:</p>
            
            <p>The traditional interpretation of the symbolism of the Cross of the Ankh is life and rebirth. It is 
            interesting to note that the unusual symbol of "life" is a very specific subtext in this example. 
            Thus, according to some interpretations, the upper part of the Cross of the Ankh (circle) symbolizes 
            the Nile River delta, and the rest is the river itself, which for the dry region of Egypt is really 
            that which feeds life. Thus, the cross of the Ankh literally embodies the "key of life".</p>

            <p>Cross of the Ankh a Symbol of Renaissance and Dawn:</p>

            <p>Yet another interpretation of the cross of the Ankh is the symbol of dawn. The cross represents 
            Genesis, life, the movement of time, and the circle above it is the sun, every day rising above the 
            Earth and initiating the beginning of a new day. Confirmation of this is in the sacred test of Ancient 
            Egypt — the Book of the Dead, where there are many images of the cross of the Ankh in the context of 
            Renaissance and Dawn, both in the direct and metaphorical sense.</p>

            <p>The Ankh key was put in the tomb by the Pharaohs so that the soul could take advantage of its magical 
            power and continue to live in the afterlife.
            It is interesting to note that it was linked by the early Christians of Egypt with the world of the 
            dead and used it to mark the afterlife.</p>

            <p>The Ankh as the universal symbol:</p>

            <p>Looking at the mysterious cross of the Ankh in terms of universal symbolism, we can highlight two main 
            elements in the image of the sign, the circle and the cross.</p>

            <p>The cross in many cultures symbolizes life as such, a combination of male and female principles 
            (the vertical bar is male, active, Yang energy, and the horizontal line is female, passive, Yin energy). 
            In other words, a cross is a symbol of human existence with very specific boundaries. The crossing 
            points of the cross are the core, the essence of the human spirit, the point of origin, beginning, 
            genesis.</p>

            <p>As for the circle, it symbolizes eternity, something unknown, infinitely knowable.</p>

            <p>If we combine these two features into one character, we see that it is a symbol of a combination of 
            divine and human, eternal and limiting. At the same time, what is characteristic, above the cross (man) 
            is the realm of eternity, the divinity — that is, the place where the spirit of human being goes — the 
            area of infinite knowledge, perfection and love.</p>

            <p>Thus, the mysterious Ankh Key is a deep metaphysical encryption, pointing to the true meaning of human 
            life as a "point", contemplating its eternal nature, which recognizes the true essence of its existence.</p>

            <p>Cross of the Ankh a symbol of Harmony:</p>

            <p>Many esoterics argue that the Ankh key also symbolically denotes a harmonious combination of male and 
            female nature, embodies the gods of Osiris (he) and Isis (she). Such that the cross itself is associated 
            with the image of phallus, and the feminine beginning is associated with a circle-the symbol of the uterus. 
            So the Ankh itself is nothing other than the sexual coitus of the two creative forces of creation, whose 
            harmonious combination gives birth to life. Thus, the Ankh Key is a graphic symbol of an ever-changing life, 
            through an infinitely dynamic balance between female and male energies, between passivity and activity, 
            between Yin and Yang, the Earth and the sky.</p>

            <p>In summary, it can be said that the Ankh is a symbol of fertility, the merging of the sexual energies of 
            male and female nature. As a result, whatever we say, we still, in some way, constantly point to the 
            symbolism of life and rebirth which the Ankh Key embodies.</p>
