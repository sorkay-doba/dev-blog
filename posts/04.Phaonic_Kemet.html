<p>Yahmesu Nefertari, the most venerated Queen of antiquity
  For more than 1000 years, Egypt bowed before the memory of this woman who had become a god, and whose life had inaugurated the rebirth of the country…

  Her divine color
  
  1730 BC, rooted in the African pacifist ideology and having not experienced major conflicts for a long time, it is an Egypt with little militarization that was attacked by the Hyksos from Asia. With disconcerting ease, foreigners seized the north of the country. Their barbarity was complete; they burnt temples and enslaved the Africans. The indigenous black power retreated to the south, leaving Lower and Middle Egypt in the hands of the invaders, obviously white nomadic from Asia.
  
  For 150 years, the kings of the south failed to retake the north. It is in this context that King Taa II ascended the throne of Egypt. He legitimized his power by marrying his sister Akhotpu, in accordance with the African matriarchal tradition. For the Egyptians, this dark period marked by the occupation of the north was to be driven out by the moon, which would again bring light to the country. That is why the 6 children of the royal couple were called “Yahmesu” which means “the Moon is born”.
  
  The eldest daughter, the one who would carry the legitimacy of power after her mother, had drawn attention from birth. The child of Akhotpu and Taa was as black as coal, as black as the Creator and the deities. She was consequently considered as a prophet and seen as the personification of the feminine part of God, heralding the return of the very much desired order. She was therefore called Yahmesu Nafooré Tiiri (Ahmes Nefertari) that is to say, The Moon is born, goodness has come.
  
  
  Nafooré Tiiri was as black as Imana/Amen (God), here in his male form in the temple of Pharaoh Hatshepsut.
  Heir to the throne, the eldest son Nebpehtyré Yahmesu was thus charged with the task, along with his sister, of restoring the sovereignty of Egypt once and for all. He had to retake the north with his military force. Nafooré Tiiri, as oracle and divine envoy, was to restore the divine order over Egypt. The two moons were to complement each other in order to reunite the two lands.
  
  Her reign and her reforms
  
  Nafooré Tiiri received an extremely advanced religious education in the holy city of Waset (Thebes), the most important city in ancient Africa. She was taught by the elite priests. Even as a young girl, she conducted ceremonies for the gods.
  
  When he reached adulthood, Pharaoh Nebpehtyré Yahmesu, assisted by his mother Akhotpu, brilliantly led a series of wars, wiping out the Hyksos. While his brother was in the chaos of the battlefield, Nafooré Tiiri, acting as the Second Prophet of God, prayed in the Theban shrines for the spirits to come to Egypt’s aid.
  
  The liberation, so ardently hoped for and finally happening, was thus seen as the action of the two moons. To legitimize his power, Nebpehtyré married his sister. The couple founded the 18thdynasty, the most prestigious of all Egyptian dynasties, inaugurating the rebirth of the country.
