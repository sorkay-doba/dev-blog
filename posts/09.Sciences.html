            <p>And Kemet offered humankind the writing…</p>
            
            <p>It is everywhere taught that the first writing ever is the Sumerian writing – Mesopotamia
             – which appeared in 3300 BC. But the researches of the Germanic Institute of Archeology led by 
             Gunter Dreyer enabled to grant this determining invention for humankind to whom may concern, it 
             is to say Blacks of Africa.</p>

             <p>The world’s oldest writing. This writing is from Black Africa.</p>

             <p>The world’s oldest writing. This writing is African (Source : Grammaire simplifiée de 
             l’égyptien hiéroglyphique, René Louis Parfait Etilé, page 14). The eminent Congolese linguist 
             Theophile Obenga teaches us that Phoenicians, who were the first Black inhabitants of the Near 
             East, originating from Africa, used to say that writing had been created by Egyptians and 
             transmitted to them. The Greek savant Diodorus reported that Nubians – from southern Egypt-Sudan 
             – had told him that it was from them that their Egyptians descendants had inherited writing [1]. 
             The Germanic Institute of Archeology discovered in Abydos, in the south of Egypt, the oldest track 
             of writing of the history of humanity. The inscriptions discovered by that team enabled to date to
              -3400 the hieroglyphs that had been found there [2].</p>

              <p>Tablets from in Uruk and Akkad in Mesopotamia show a type of ‘writing’ dating from -3200 
              BC. The problem is that this ‘writing’ doesn’t express sounds. Therefore it’s not writing. If 
              one compares that with Africa, we have the Lebombo bone found in Swaziland and that is the first 
              proof of mathematics of humanity. The inscriptions on the Lebombo bone date from -37000. It 
              should therefore be compared -37,000 to -3,200. The authentic Sumerian writing dates from -3060. 
              And the said Sumerians were Blacks.</p>

              Sumerian writing, 2600 BC:</p>

              <p><img src="../assets/img/Writing.jpeg" alt="Kemetic, semitic, phenician, greec, 
              roman writings"></p>

              <p>Writing was taken to Greece by the Phoenicia’s Blacks led by Cadmus after they settled 
              there around -1450 ; and this information was confirmed by the ancient Greeks themselves. It 
              was then through contact with the Black civilizers of the Near East originating from Africa 
              that Europe had for the first time a writing around the 9th century BC; it is to say almost 
              2600 years at least after Africa. It is that Greek alphabet which gave birth to the current 
              Latin one we used to write this article. The French historian and epigraph Pierre Bordreuil, 
              experienced researcher at the CNRS (France) says ‘what’s extraordinary with the Phoenician 
              alphabet is that it is the ancestor of our alphabets’ [3].</p>

              <p>As the European writing is originating from the Phoenician writing and the Phoenician 
              writing is originating from the African one, the European writing is therefore originating 
              from the African one.</p>
