          <p>Cairo conference, 1974 : Unesco acknowleges that Egyptians were Blacks
            More than 40 years ago, a very significant event in Cairo marked the history of the 
            African historiography: it is the international Conference on Egyptology organized by 
            the UNESCO from January 28 to February 3, 1974 in Cairo, Egypt. Let us recall briefly 
            this global event unknown to the general public (including the African public).</p>
            
            <p>Why was the Cairo Conference held ?</p>
            
            <p>The Cairo conference was held as part of UNESCO’s writings on African history. In other 
            words, the UNESCO wrote a lot on African history in several volumes and at a moment the 
            question that arose was as follows: should we classify the history of the Pharaonic 
            civilization in the context of African history? Yes or no?</p>
            
            
            <p>UNESCO logo
            In order to be able to put the Pharaonic civilization in the African context, it was 
            necessary to prove scientifically that the Pharaonic civilization (by its culture, 
            language, and languages and also by its people) belonged to the African World.</p>
            
            <p>Why did it have to be proved?</p>
            
            <p>This had to be proved because the misrepresentation by Egyptologists was already 
            effective through the construction of several lies. And because of those 
            misrepresentations, there were 3 schools:</p>
            
            <p>The first and most important one was the school of western scholars and experts. 
            According to them, the people who created the Pharaonic civilization were a white 
            people from Europe who had landed in Africa to create this civilization, while 
            tanning and mingling themselves with African (black) elements over time. Therefore, 
            according to this school of thought, the Pharaonic people had a European white origin 
            and the shades of dark or black skin visible on the Pharaonic frescoes were only the 
            results of race-mixing.</p>           
            
            <p>Scene taken from a film directed by westerners on the Pharaonic civilization. We see 
            that in their films, westerners still use white or light-skinned human types to play 
            the roles of Egyptians. This habit of taking whites or light-skinned characters to play 
            the role of Egyptians is based on the western lie according to which Pharaonic people 
            are white.</p>

            <p>The second school of thought is the school of orientalist researchers or the specialists 
            of the so-called oriental civilizations. According to this school, the Pharaonic people 
            came from the East to create their civilization on the African soil.</p>            
            
            <p>The third (and last) school was one of those who claimed that the Pharaonic civilization 
            was a black one created by Blacks and belonged to the African world. It was the stance 
            embodied by Cheikh Anta Diop and Theophile Obenga and also the most challenged school of 
            thought by orientalist and western scholars who were already broadcasting – at that time 
            through their media (as they still do today) – all sort of things to prove that the 
            Pharaonic civilization was not black.</p>            
            
            <p>Usiré (Osiris), the great Black (one of his names in the Pharaonic texts), sitting on the 
            divine throne.</p>

            <p>Faced with this situation of 3 schools, then 3 different stances, it was necessary to 
            definitely reach an opinion based on rigorous and scientific criteria about this question 
            of the Pharaonic civilization which divided the ones and the others. This is why the UNESCO 
            organized the International Conference on Egyptology in Cairo and invited all the great 
            specialists and their delegations to organize a confrontation between all researchers and 
            specialists from all horizons (including Africans) to solve this problem and to put an end 
            to the debate on the Pharaonic civilization. Cheikh Anta Diop and Théophile Obenga met at 
            that conference.</p>            
            
            <p>Cheikh Anta Diop and Théophile Obenga
            The symposium addressed the topic of the peopling of ancient Egypt and the decipherment of 
            the Meroitic writing. But the fundamental problem which concerned everyone was:</p>
            
            <p>Who were the Pharaonic people? Were they Africans or not?</p>
            
            <p>Twenty specialists, five observers and two UNESCO representatives from fourteen different 
            nations spent many hours and several days on this issue.</p>

            <p>Cheikh Anta Diop and Théophile Obenga were the only ones among all participants asserting 
            that the Pharaonic civilization was a black civilization. They were just two to represent 
            Africa, against all other scholars.</p>

            at one of the work sessions.
            To prove that the Pharaonic civilization was an African civilization, it was not simply a 
            question of establishing that the Pharaonic people had black skin. It was necessary not to 
            be limited to the skin. It was also important to prove that the people:
            Used to speak African languages
            Possessed an African culture, customs and traditions</p>
            
            <p>In order to technically and scientifically prove all the above mentioned, it was significant 
            to rely on many subjects such as archeology, anthropology, biology, chemistry, geography, 
            linguistics, dating and many more by using the methods of all these areas. It was therefore 
            a work of study and intense research that needed to be done and a scientific battle at a very 
            high level. Indeed, since there were specialists from all over the world, failure was not option.</p>
            
            
            <p>Cheikh Anta Diop using a board to perform a demonstration at the conference
            At the end of the scientific symposium, the works of Cheikh Anta Diop and Theophile Obenga, 
            who said that the Pharaonic civilization is an African civilization, had triumphed. That is 
            why in the general conclusion of the final report of the conference it is written that:
            “The very detailed preparation of the presentations by Professors Cheikh Anta Diop and Obenga 
            did not always get an equal feedback despite the clarifications set out in the preparatory 
            working document sent by the UNESCO (see Appendix 3). As a consequence, discussions were not 
            balanced”.</p>
            
            
            <p>The final report of the 1974 Cairo Conference held by the UNESCO (first edition)
            In other words, when Diop and Obenga were scientifically demonstrating the black characteristics 
            of the Pharaonic civilization to other scholars and experts, the latter could not really 
            challenge their massive and important statements. It therefore led to unbalanced scientific 
            debates despite the scholars’ large number and skills.</p>
            
            <p>The final report of the 1974 Cairo Conference held by the UNESCO (second edition).</p>
            
            <p>Thanks to the scientific battle led by Professors Diop and Obenga, it has now been more than 
            40 years since science definitely showed that the Pharaonic civilization is a black civilization. 
            It has been more than 40 years since science delivered its judgment. Therefore, it has been 
            more than 40 years since the international scientific community knew for sure that the pharaonic 
            civilization is neither white nor oriental or anything else but a black civilization indeed, 
            an African civilization. And all the serious research carried out over time confirms the black 
            identity of the Pharaonic civilization.</p>
            
            
            <p>Divine father Ay, Akhenaton’s initiator, wearing a leopard skin, performing a rite on the 
            deceased Pharaoh, the Osiris Tuanga Imana (Tutankhamen). The custom of wearing a leopard skin 
            is a custom not found in Western culture neither Eastern nor Semitic culture, but in African 
            culture.</p>
            <p>The conference instruments are still in existence today and are kept by the UNESCO, but Africa’s 
            enemies are deliberately ignoring the existence of the symposium and pretend that it never took 
            place. This is why people (including Africans) ignorantly still continue to ask questions about 
            the origin of the Pharaonic civilization, while this issue has already been solved through 
            science 40 years ago.</p>
            
            <p>If Westerners still continue to lie about the Pharaonic civilization today through the media or 
            in so-called scientific books, documentaries or so, it is for reasons not grounded on science or 
            truth. Today as far as we are concerned, let us remember the conference as a moment when Maat 
            (Truth, Justice and Order) triumphed over Isefet (disorder, lie and bad ways)!</p>
            
            <p>Let us celebrate the moment where Cheikh Anta Diop and Obenga accomplished a huge task for 
            African historiography! Let us celebrate the moment where only two sons of the continent 
            brilliantly made the land of their ancestors victorious in the world’s face!</p>
            
            
            <p>Cheikh Anta Diop and Théophile Obenga made Ma’at (Truth, Justice and Order) prevail at the 
            symposium.</p>
            <p>Let us recall this sentence of Osiris Cheikh Anta Diop at that moment:
            “Even today, among all the peoples on earth, a black person from black Africa can identify on 
            their own and in an exhaustive manner, the core identity of their culture with that of Pharaonic 
            Egypt, so that both cultures can serve as reciprocal reference systems. He is the only one who 
            can still identify him indubitably to the Egyptian cultural universe. He/she feels at home. He 
            does not feel out of place, as any other man/woman would be, whether Indo-European or Semitic. 
            The way a Westerner feels the echo of his ancestors’ soul till date by reading Caton’s text is 
            the same way the psychology and culture revealed by the Egyptian texts identify with the black 
            personality. And African studies will emerge from the vicious circle in which they evolve to 
            find their full meaning and fruitfulness only by moving towards the Nile Valley “(Cheikh Anta 
            Diop, Antériorité des Civilisations Nègres, p.12).</p>
            
            <p>And let us also remember this recommendation from Osiris Diop:
            “With equal knowledge, the truth conquers. Train yourself, arm yourself with science to the 
            teeth (…) and reclaim your cultural heritage.“</p>
            
            <p>And let us pay homage to all African scholars as well as black and historians of African 
            ancestry who make science work and who use their science to serve the continent and use their 
            knowledge to serve the black world as Cheikh Anta Diop and Théophile Obenga did!</p>
