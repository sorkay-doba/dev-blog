          <p>Djoser, Imhotep and the step Pyramid at Saqqara

            Our teaching moment for today takes us back to Africa and specifically to that place now 
            called Egypt.  It was not always called Egypt.  Indeed, we know it by a number of names.  
            Sometimes it is called Ta-Meri.  That means "the Beloved Land." It is also known as the 
            Two Lands because there was a kingdom in the South and a kingdom in the North.  But most 
            of us today call it Kmt.  Kmt means "the Black City" or "Black Community."  
            
            We spend a lot of time with Kmt because, for one, it lasted so long and it was so spectacular. 
            And, secondly, because, although we don't know everything about it, compared to many African 
            civilizations, the history of Kmt is pretty well documented.  And, point number three, it has 
            in a way been taken out of Africa and we indeed to restore it and put it back!
            
            So let's got to Kmt and let's focus on what some of us consider the world's first truly golden 
            Age.
            
            We go now to the Third Dynasty--the third documented royal family--and look at two of the 
            greatest personalities and the monument that they are forever associated with--the building 
            called the Step Pyramid.
            
            DJOSER
            
            King Djoser reigned about 2700 BCE and is the best-known pharaoh of the Third Dynasty of Kmt. 
            Some have suggested that he was Sudanese in origin.  He commissioned his outstanding official 
            Imhotep to construct his tomb--the first of the pyramids--a step pyramid, for him at Saqqara. 
            Variants of Djoser’s name include Zoser.  The painted limestone statue of Djoser, now in the 
            Egyptian Museum in Cairo, is the oldest known life-sized statue from Kmt.   
            
            Djoser is thought have ruled Kmt for about thirty years, dispatched several military 
            expeditions to the Sinai Peninsula, and sent expeditions there to mine for valuable minerals 
            such as turquoise and copper.
            
            THE STEP PYRAMID
            
            The Step Pyramid at Saqqara, Egypt is one of my favorite buildings from the ancient world. 
            Saqqara itself is just a short drive from Cairo and even closer to Giza--which is where the 
            biggest and most famous pyramids are.
            
            The Step Pyramid is just over 200 feet high.  It is made of limestone and was designed as 
            King Djoser''s burial place.  
            
            The Step Pyramid is the world's first pyramid and it is also the world's first large stone 
            building.  And it was designed by am African for an African nearly five-thousand years ago.
            
            I have been to the Step Pyramid at least twenty times and I am in awe every time. 
            
            The Step Pyramid was designed by the African genius man called Imhotep.
            
            IMHOTEP: MULTI-GENIUS AND WORLD’S FIRST SCIENTIST
            
            Perhaps no person who was not a king distinguished so much and left a greater legacy than 
            Imhotep. Writer, poet, designer of the world’s first large stone builder, the planet’s first 
            known physician, prime minister and high priest, astronomer and astrologer Imhotep was truly 
            a man for the ages.  "Is there another like Imhotep?"  It was a well-earned praise, this 
            passage from a text written more than a thousand years after his death.  
            
            By 600 B.C.E., Imhotep--architecture and chief minister of King Djoser around 2850 BCE--was 
            elevated to the stature of a deity, and Greece and Rome saw in him their god of healing.
            
            The photos here, like all of the photos in my teaching moments, I have taken on my numerous 
            trips to the museums and archaeological sites around the world.  Both photos here of Djoser 
            (look at the locs he is wearing) and Imhotep are in the Egyptian Museum Cairo and are 
            prominently featured in my newest book The Black Image in Antiquity: Beautiful, Royal and 
            Divine.  Together, with the Step Pyramid, they make a wonderful collage!
